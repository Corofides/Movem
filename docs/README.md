## Movem Game

This repository is for the development of the Movem game in Kotlin and the KorGE Game Engine.

Movem, also known as Robotics Life  was originally released in 1989 for the Amiga. A socban game involving moving items through a maze like structure to various points in different levels.

## About Us

James Lendrem - James works for Kino Creative as a web developer and started programming at 13 in order to bypass school rules about not playing games on the school computers. Originally just breaking Dragon Ball Z games and ripping Pokemon sprites out of GBA roms he eventually decided he could just pretend he knew what he was doing and that seems to have worked ever since. This is his first project in Kotlin or KorGE.

Alex Hedley - James will leave this here for Alex to fill out...

Game Programming Patterns

Useful introduction to some patterns to use in Game Programming. I've based the movement system of the command pattern in this book and I'm sure we'll be using more patterns
